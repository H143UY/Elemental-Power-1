  Infoamtion: Blaze, a young man with the ability to control fire, is always afraid
    of his power and lives aloof from everyone. When a mysterious shadow attacks
    Ignis village, Blaze is forced to face his fears to protect his homeland. During
    the fierce battle, he realized that the fire within him was not an enemy, but
    a source of endless power when controlled.  Blaze defeats the shadow, saves the
    village, and learns to accept himself. From then on, he became a protector, using
    his fire to protect those he loved.
